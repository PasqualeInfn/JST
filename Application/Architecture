Using the MVC design pattern (Model View Control) were obtained at three distinct layers:

• View
• Business logic
• Access to data

Therefore they were written a series of libraries, opportunely referenced and integrated with each other.

The main package is written:
• Service: library, in FrontEnd package, containing the methods available to the service
• XmlEntityLayer: dll to serialize / deserialize the XML response format of the service (Map of the responses in XML)
• EntityLayer: dll file that maps the database tables
• BusinessLayer: dll file containing the business logic for the management of the db and methods of service
• DataLayer: dll containing classes and methods for accessing data in the db
• Core: dll containing various utilities and functionality
