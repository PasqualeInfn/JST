The application called "BackEnd" is a daemon, based on a MultiThread strategy, constantly
running. It regularly queries the TaskList to understand if there are Jobs to be executed and, if
there are, submits them to the computing resources for which it is configured.
The behaviour of the BackEnd instance and of the Jobs depends from the type of submission.

• Interactive instance or job submission on a dedicated server.

Using the multithread characteristic of the BackEnd, the job is started in a newly created
thread on the same server where the "BackEnd" is in execution. As soon as a job is started,
the BackEnd takes care of updating the TaskList in order to remove that particular job from
the list of job still to be executed.

• All other cases
In all other cases is the job itself, when it start executing on a Worker Node of the batch
cluster, or on a worker node of the grid infrastructure or on a Cloud computing resource,
that updates the TaskList information.
In all case the BackEnd daemon checks regularly that all Job relative to the same InsertID have
been successful completed. In this case it send to the user a notifications mail retrieving the
required information (i.e. the user mail addresse) from the TaskList.
